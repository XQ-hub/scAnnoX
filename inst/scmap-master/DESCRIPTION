Description: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is widely used to investigate the 
            composition of complex tissues since the technology allows researchers to 
            define cell-types using unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome. 
            However, due to differences in experimental methods and computational 
            analyses, it is often challenging to directly compare the cells identified 
            in two different experiments. scmap is a method for projecting cells 
            from a scRNA-seq experiment on to the cell-types or individual cells 
            identified in a different experiment.
